I create this project for my mca final year.
In this project cnn model contained the  layers that are: covolution,relu,max-pooling,fullyconnected,softmax.
im using FER-2013 dataset for training and validation download by this link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013/download?datasetVersionNumber=1.
if you download it. it was got a trainig and testing two named folders and set that path in the program then you can easily run it.
if you think the training was take more time.then don't worry about it!i give it the already builded and saved model.if you need then you can easily use it
i save this model and use that same model for three various type of modules that are images,videos and live camera
